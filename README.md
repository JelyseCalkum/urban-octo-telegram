This project was built to ensure I can recognize the correct HTML and CSS formats, as well as the proper placement and purpose of the code's tags, attributes, and images. 

This project solves the problem of creating a project that is messy and unnecessarily complicated. With my new understanding, I can create accessible, clean, consolidated code and pass that efficiency onto my fellow teammates working on the project.

I learned that attention to detail is critical in coding and that the proper placement of the code's tags and attributes is important for not only the functionality and accessibility of the website, but also for your fellow developers who will be working on the code with you.

I believe my project stands out in that it is concise, efficient, and not filled with any unnecessary information.
